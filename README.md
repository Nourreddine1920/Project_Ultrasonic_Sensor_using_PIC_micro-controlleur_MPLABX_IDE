# Project_Ultrasonic_Sensor_using_PIC_micro-controlleur_MPLABX_IDEOb
#Objectif : 
In this project , i’0ll show you how HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors work and how to interface 
them with pic microcontrollers in MPLAB IDE XC8 compiler. we’ll also discuss what are their 
applications and how to use this sort of sensor with microchip pic microcontrollers. 
I’ll be developing the necessary firmware to interface the ultrasonic sensor and display
the readings on a breadboard. It’s going to be an interesting project , so let’s get started!
